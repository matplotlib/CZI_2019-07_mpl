\title{Matplotlib - Foundation of Scientific Visualization in Python}
\author{}
\maketitle

\section{Goals}

Matplotlib\cite{Hunter:2007} is the fundamental
data visualization library for the scientific Python Ecosystem, used
in conjunction with other foundational tools like NumPy and
SciPy \cite{Jones2001} by over a million\footnote{Estimated from \texttt{pypi}
and \texttt{conda} download numbers and unique monthly visitors to the documentation website} users.
Matplotlib is used across a wide spectrum of fields, including bio-medical imaging,
microscopy, and genomics \cite{Carpenter2006,Wolf2018,10.7717/peerj.453,
  Segata2011,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695,HASHIMSHONY2012666,
  10.1093/bioinformatics/bts480,Carlile2014,Laganowsky2014,Jiangaac9462,
  10.3389/fninf.2014.00014}, and we expect this user base to grow as Python
  continues to be adopted in the life sciences. %%?citation needed that this still happening?
Matplotlib has been actively developed and maintained by a vibrant,
primarily volunteer, community over the last 16 years; however, given
the scale, scope, and importance of the project, we are at the limit
of what we can sustainably maintain and develop with mostly
volunteer effort.

To strengthen the library and lay the groundwork for future versions, this proposal asks for 2.4 person-years of developer effort to support:


\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*),noitemsep]
  \item Fostering community, documentation, and tools to grow a rich ecosystem of domain-specific libraries built on Matplotlib
  \item Maintaining the library and contributor base
  \item Developing a comprehensive plan to evolve the core architecture
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Fostering downstream projects}
\label{sec:downstream}
We will engage with libraries in the life sciences that are using Matplotlib for their visualization to ensure that we are addressing their problems and to collaborate on prototyping an end-to-end solution, including data, plot representations, and a high-level user API.
In particular we plan to engage with \texttt{scikit-learn}\footnote{Also applying for Essential Open Source
Software for Science}, \texttt{CellProfiler}\footnote{Currently funded
by CZI\label{f:czi}}, \texttt{scanpy}\footref{f:czi}, \texttt{starfish}\footref{f:czi}, \texttt{nipy}, and
\texttt{scikit-image}\footref{f:czi} \cite{10.7717/peerj.453,Carpenter2006, Wolf2018}

Our goal is to make these libraries and others like them easier to write. The most common visualizations in a domain need to be fluid for the end-practitioners, with the ``obvious'' customization options exposed. Much of the domain-specific specialization is carried in the structure, semantics and assumptions of the data, and in the standard visualizations of the domain. These specializations can vary widely, in contradictory ways, between domains. Because no high-level API can simultaneously satisfy all of the visualization needs, there will always be a need for domain-specific visualization libraries.

Through maintaining the code base and developing the architecture for the next version, we will generate API guidelines so that downstream libraries inter-operate well and ``feel'' similar. By building out community, documentation, and tools, we will provide downstream library developers resources for efficiently building their tools with Matplotlib.

\subsection{Maintenance and Growth of Library and Community}

Matplotlib is a community-driven project, but we have grown to the point where we need developers with the time to organize, plan, and make decisions. Issues and PRs are submitted faster than our volunteers can
review them; for the past few years we have resolved approximately 40 Issues and 30 PRs a month, but every month about 50 new Issues are opened and 40 PRs are submitted.

We have accumulated about 1200 open Issues and 300 open PRs due to this imbalance. There may be critical bug reports or insightful feature requests among the former, while among the latter are useful contributions or bug fixes that would improve Matplotlib for direct users and downstream packages. The backlog is discouraging for new and occasional contributors and distracting for core developers.

To maintain Matplotlib's health we need to:
%% these can probably be shortened further, to just stuff like Triage and on board
%%since explainations are in text
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item fix critical bugs and regressions;
\item triage the backlog of Issues and PRs in terms of topic, difficulty, and urgency and promptly triage newly opened Issues and PRs;
\item maintain backward compatibility and extensively document intentional changes;
\item on-board new contributors to sustain and diversify developer team;
\item and manage discussions about proposed enhancements, features, and API changes.
\end{itemize}

The requested support for developers is intended to complement and facilitate, not replace, crucial volunteer work. We aim to better co-ordinate and nurture their efforts, with the goal of growing and sustaining a diverse community of volunteer and paid expert contributors.
We view this proposal as the start of a new phase for Matplotlib, in which we will need to find support from a variety of sources in the coming years.

\subsection{Road-map and Architecture}
Matplotlib needs sustained attention to update the library's architecture for the next decade.
Developed over 15 years ago\footnote{\url{https://www.aosabook.org/en/matplotlib.html}} \cite{Hunter:2007}, it has served us well, but it does not reflect recent developments in software design, data structures, and visualization. We aim to take advantage of these developments to improve the consistency, composability, and discoverabilty of the API. The ultimate goal is facilitating rich interactive domain-specific visualizations.


%% We will develop
%% plans for refactoring the core library to facilitate its extension and
%% to smooth interoperability among the core library and the various
%% domain-specific plotting tools.
%% We will investigate how to update Matplotlib's
%% internal data model to use the information embedded in structured
%% data and allow fluid updating.

\subsubsection{Homogenization of the Application Programming Interface (API)}
\label{sec:api_hom}
% should we merge this into the next section?
The library has grown organically over time through the contributions of over 900 individuals, accumulating many small inconsistencies in the API. For example, similar methods have different
argument order, e.g., \texttt{ax.text(x, y, s)} vs
\texttt{ax.annotation(s, (x, y))}, and some keyword (named) arguments can be
singular or plural, e.g., \texttt{color} vs \texttt{colors}.  These
subtle issues add friction for users, but are hard to fix without
breaking existing code for someone in our large user base.  Our goal is
to minimize breakage, while still unifying the API. Taking into account
\textbf{all} of the public function signatures, we will carefully consider which to leave as
they are, which to deprecate, and which to replace.

\subsubsection{API generalization}
\label{sec:api_gen}
Matplotlib has two main user-facing APIs, the \texttt{pyplot} API
and the \texttt{Object Oriented} (\texttt{OO})
API.  The former closely follows MATLAB and is built
around the concept of a global ``current Axes'' drawing surface.
Although \texttt{pyplot} can be convenient for interactive terminal
usage, it is easy to lose track of which Axes is the ``current Axes'',
particularly when library functions, where code is typically hidden
from the user, are also using \texttt{pyplot}.
This uncertainty as to which Axes is the ``current Axes'' frequently results in data being
plotted to wrong and surprising places. The \texttt{OO} interface is more flexible and
explicit but verbose.

The main namespace for plotting methods in the \texttt{OO} API is
the \texttt{Axes} class, which leads to three issues:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Third party domain-specific packages can never feel ``First
Class'', as their plotting functions will not be implemented as
\texttt{Axes} methods like the ``built-in'' ones.
%% not really explained why this is bad
\item Some visualizations require plotting to multiple \texttt{Axes}es, which
doesn't fit the model in which plots are made via \texttt{Axes} methods.
\item There are over 250 methods on the \texttt{Axes}, making it hard to use tab-completion to
search for a method.
\end{enumerate}

To address these issues, we will move to a primary API in which
top-level functions take in data, style, and \texttt{Axes}(es) and
return \texttt{Artist}s.  These functions will use consistent naming
and call conventions, as discussed in \ref{sec:api_hom}, and return the
\texttt{Artist}s discussed in section \ref{sec:artists}. From the
large pool of plotting functions, augmented in collaboration with
downstream libraries, we will curate domain-specific namespaces to
facilitate discoverability.

This large-scale refactoring requires dedicated developer time to
carefully consider the consequences, in consultation with our users.


\subsubsection{Rich, Semantic \texttt{Artist}s}
\label{sec:artists}
\texttt{Artist}s are the ``middle layer'' of Matplotlib that encodes a plot's type, look, and data.  \texttt{Artist}s know how to translate user specifications to rendered output, and users interact with the \texttt{Artist} objects to update the data or aesthetics.

We need to embrace composite artists to provide a smarter, more uniform \texttt{Artist} API.
Matplotlib has a mix of ``primitive'' \texttt{Artist}s (e.g., lines, images, and text) and ``composite'' artists (e.g., the whole \texttt{Axes}). The mapping between the user API and the \texttt{Artist}s can be
one-to-one, but often one user call will generate many decoupled primitive \texttt{Artist}s.
For example, \texttt{hist} displays a histogram, notionally a single entity to the user,
but returns a list of independent \texttt{Rectangle} \texttt{Artist}s (one per bin).
If the user wants to update the data or the aesthetics, they must adjust each \texttt{Rectangle} independently.
Instead, the functions discussed in \ref{sec:api_gen} should return objects with
a uniform update interface, making interactive visualizations easier to develop.


\subsubsection{Data Model}
\label{sec:dm}
Matplotlib needs a consistent way for \texttt{Artist}s to access their underlying data. Currently, each plotting method and \texttt{Artist} handles sanitizing and storing data independently. Hence, some common functionality, such as handling data with attached units (e.g., degrees Celsius, dates), is scattered throughout the code base. This leads to inconsistencies across the library and makes it difficult for users to write code that updates interactive explorations and animations. Matplotlib also cannot exploit ``Structured data''--combining multiple pieces of (possibly heterogeneous) data with labels and metadata into single data structure; instead, users must extract data elements and reassemble them as arguments to Matplotlib plotting functions.

We will develop a data access API such that each \texttt{Artist} will have a single \texttt{Data} object responsible for holding the data. This model will be the technical underpinning to handle, exploit, and
update structured data in a coherent fashion. By removing direct data storage from the \texttt{Artist}s and defining an API for data sources we will enable

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item native consumption of structured data,
  \item smart down-sampling of plotted data based on view limits,
  \item seamless updating of the underlying data, either interactively or via streams,
  \item and use of alternative data sources such as database queries or analytic functions.
\end{itemize}

This will decouple the implementation of the data sources from the \texttt{Artist}s.  Downstream libraries will be able to provide sophisticated data sources to the core library \texttt{Artists}, build complex \texttt{Artist}s that use those sources, and create specialized forms of the data model.

% \subsubsection{Additional Export Methods}
% % maybe nuke this section?
% Matplotlib \texttt{Figure}s can render to either raster or vector
% file formats, displaying the result in an interactive window or
% saving it to disk.  There is
% currently no good way to save and reopen a Matplotlib \texttt{Figure} or
% export it to another plotting library, such as \texttt{bokeh},
% \texttt{d3} or \texttt{QtCharts}.  In addition, due to the way Matplotlib
% internals are implemented, it is difficult to take advantage of GPUs to
% accelerate drawing. To address these problems, we will investigate adding two additional
% export paths.  One, at a high-level, will be suitable for subsequent re-input
% to Matplotlib and for interoperability with other high-level plotting
% libraries. The second, at a low scene-graph level, will be suitable for passing
% to a GPU.

\section{Expected outcomes, success evaluation and metrics}
\subsection{Maintenance}

Quantitatively evaluating maintenance work can be tricky---some Issues
or PRs take minutes to review while others can take days to
months of effort---but we believe that there is value at looking at
the number of open Issues and PRs.  We will reduce this number by closing Issues and PRs faster than they are opened until a reasonable equilibrium is reached. With the introduction of paid developers, NumPy has had success in reversing the ever increasing trends in the number of Issues and Pull Requests\footnote{https://github.com/seberg/numpy\_talk\_plots/blob/master/plots\_used\_in\_talk/issues\_prs\_delta.pdf}. Once the backlog is handled, we aim to have all new Issues and Pull Requests labeled within 7 days of being opened.

Improved contributor onboarding should yield an increase in the percentage of new contributor PRs that get resolved, a decrease in the amount of time it takes for resolution, and an increase the number of PRs submitted by non-core developers.


\subsection{Road-map and Architecture}

We will write a white paper with a road map documenting the proposed design, critical use-cases, and requirements for the data model and API overhaul.

% JMK Does this section need more?
% EF Would the prototyping just show what use of the API would look like?
%    How much of the actual mpl implementation would be expected?
%    What is actually feasible in a year?
%    It is OK for the proposal to be ambitious, but it should also
%    show some recognition of reality.

\section{Downstream Libraries}
To validate the design, we will develop end-to-end prototypes targeting one or more of the life-science libraries discussed in \ref{sec:downstream}, and qualitatively assess downstream library developers' engagement with these prototypes.

\section{Work Plan}

We request funding for the following:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]

\item Fund Thomas Caswell's position at 40\%.  Caswell is the Lead Developer of Matplotlib and an Associate
  Computational Scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  His
  long-term experience, API design expertise, and project leadership
  are critical to the success of the work in this proposal.  He will work
  on all aspects of the proposal.
\item Hannah Aizenman's position for 12 months.  Aizenman has
  been a core developer of Matplotlib for three years. She has helped
  lead outreach efforts and is the author of a recent feature set.
  She is a PhD candidate in Computer Science, studying visualization at The
  Graduate Center, CUNY. Her work on the architecture of Matplotlib will be
  the basis of her PhD thesis. Aizenman will take
  the lead on the data model design and new-contributor on-boarding.
\item Summer support for Michael Grossberg, Aizenman's PhD advisor.
\item 12 months of a yet-to-be identified software engineer to support all aspects of the proposal but focusing on maintenance, prototyping, and engaging down-stream libraries.
\item Travel to key conferences (such as SciPy or PyCon) and for in-person meetings
\end{itemize}

We want to use this dedicated effort to leverage and empower the Matplotlib developer community.  In terms of direct work, equal amounts of time will be spent mentoring and reviewing code from community members and directly implementing features or fixing bugs.  All of the design work will be done in public with
input from the community. Part of this work is to develop the project Road Map.
